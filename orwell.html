        <p style="font-family:courier;"><b>
            Eric Arthur Blair (25 June 1903 – 21 January 1950), known by his pen name
            George Orwell, was an English novelist, essayist, journalist
            and critic. His work is characterised by lucid prose, social 
            criticism, opposition to totalitarianism, and support of democratic socialism.
            Orwell produced literary criticism and poetry, fiction and polemical
            journalism. He is known for the allegorical novella Animal Farm (1945)
            and the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949).<br> His non-fiction works,
            including The Road to Wigan Pier (1937), documenting his experience of
            working-class life in the industrial north of England, and Homage to 
            Catalonia (1938), an account of his experiences soldiering for the Republican 
            faction of the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), are as critically 
            respected as his essays on politics and literature, language and culture.
