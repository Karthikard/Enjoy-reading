        <p style="font-family:courier;"><b>Joanne Rowling born 31 July 1965), also known by her pen
            name J. K. Rowling, is a British author and philanthropist.
            She wrote a seven-volume children's fantasy series, 
            Harry Potter, published from 1997 to 2007. The series has 
            been enormously successful: it has sold over 500 million 
            copies, been translated into at least 70 languages, and spawned 
            a global media franchise including films and video games.
            The Casual Vacancy (2012) was her first novel for adults.
            She writes Cormoran Strike, an ongoing crime fiction series,
            as Robert Galbraith.<br>
            Born in Yate, Rowling graduated with a degree in French
             from the University of Exeter in 1987 and began working temp 
             jobs as a bilingual secretary.<br> In 1990, the idea for the 
             characters of Harry Potter came to her while she waited on 
             a delayed train; later that year, her mother died of multiple 
             sclerosis. In the seven years before publication of the first Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (1997), Rowling moved to Portugal, married, had a daughter, relocated to Scotland when her marriage failed, divorced, and earned a teaching certificate. She wrote while living on state assistance as a single parent, deeply affected by her mother's death.
            By 2008, Forbes had named her the world's highest-paid author.
            <br>
            Rowling concluded the Harry Potter series with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007). </p></b>
