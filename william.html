        <p style="font-family:courier;"><b>William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616)
             was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded 
             as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist.
             He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard").
             His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays,
            154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, 
            some of uncertain authorship. <br>His plays have been translated into every major living language 
            and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.
            His works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.</p></b>
